# WebGL Line Animations

A React component for drawing and animating lines. (Currently this repository is exploratory and experimental)

The roadmap for the future is to develop a React component `<WebGLLineAnimation />` and bind an function that animates features within the canvas. Such features will include straight lines, arcs, dots and circles. Animation types for such features include fade in/out, move vertex, change color, move anchor.

There is no API currently designed for the animation technique or any examples (this is a TODO).

# Live Preview

Use `npm start` or `yarn start` to begin the live development server.
